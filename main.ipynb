        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This script facilitates the extraction and processing of transcripts from YouTube videos. It leverages the [youtube-transcript-api](https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api) to obtain the raw transcript, allowing users to choose between auto-generated and user-added subtitles. For detailed features and options, refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api).\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the raw transcript is obtained, the script enhances it by adding punctuations using [oliverguhr/fullstop-punctuation-multilang-large](https://huggingface.co/oliverguhr/fullstop-punctuation-multilang-large). This versatile project supports multiple languages for punctuation addition. Please note that punctuation addition may take some time, depending on the length of the video.\n",
        "\n",
        "For reference, it took approximately 5 minutes and 17 seconds to generate the raw transcription and add punctuations for a 1 hour and 38-minute-long video.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "- [youtube-transcript-api](https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api)\n",

        "## Usage\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Open the [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n",
        "2. Click on **File > Save a copy in Drive** to create your own version.\n",
        "3. Adjust the script parameters as needed.\n",
        "4. Execute the script cell to process the YouTube video transcript.\n",

            "# Why Antibiotics Don't Work Like They Used To. ## Intro. antibiotics are very commonly used medications, and they have been an incredible tool for curing infectious diseases and saving lives, but there are also some potential negative consequences that can come with taking antibiotics, some of which can be quite serious. so in today's video, we're going to talk about how antibiotics work, the good things they can do for the human body, but also some of those potential negative effects, and, of course, we'll discuss some concerns around their future use and antibiotic resistance. it's definitely going to be a fun one, so let's do this. so what are antibiotics and how do? ## What are Antibiotics? Killing Bacteria But Not Own Cells? they work. antibiotics are substances that kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria, and one of the coolest and Most Fascinating Concepts that I remember learning about as a microbiology student- and this concept's very important to how antibiotics actually work- is something called selective toxicity. we want these antibiotics to be selectively toxic, meaning we want them to be harmful to the bacteria but not to our own human cells, and this is accomplished by exploiting the differences between the metabolism and the structure of the bacteria versus our own human cells, and there are some major differences between bacteria and our cells. for example, bacteria have a cell wall. our cells do not. bacteria also have some major differences in their ribosomes and their nucleic acids, like DNA, and also some subtle differences in their cell membrane. remember, a cell membrane is different than a cell wall and antibiotics do a pretty good job at exploiting or targeting these differences. so let's give some examples of how antibiotics work to exploit some of these differences and then we can discuss some of the good things that antibiotics do for the human body, as well as some concerns or considerations with taking them. and as we get into how antibiotics work, it's also useful to know that antibiotics can be bacterio cdal or bacteriostatic. a bacterio cidal antibiotic will actually kill the bacteria, whereas a bacteriostatic antibiotic will slow or inhibit the growth of the bacteria. so if someone were taking a BAC ostatic antibiotic, they'd also need their immune system to come in and help with the killing, because if you remove that bacteriostatic antibiotic, the bacteria could start growing again. but both bacterio cdal and bacteriostatic antibiotics have been used successfully to treat multiple different types of: ## How Antibiotics Kill Bacteria, Cell Wall, Ribosomes & DNA infections. some of the most common antibiotics that you've likely heard of work to kill bacteria by inhibiting the synthesis of their cell wall, which is pretty easy to exploit, because human cells don't have a cell wall and if the bacteria cannot link certain compon on of their cell wall together during cell division, water will rush in, causing the bacterial cell to rupture and die. and, like I said, some of the most common antibiotics work this way: the betalactams- now you may not have heard of them as called the betalactams, but you've likely heard of the penicillin and maybe even the sephos sporin, a very common penicillin is like something like a moxacin. maybe you've even heard of a seyos sporin that's commonly used, like seex and also known as Keflex. there are also multiple antibiotics that work to inhibit protein synthesis of bacteria without interfering with the protein synthesis in human cells. now, you may have heard me mention ribosomes earlier on, and if you've taken a biology class, you may remember that ribosomes are these cool structures inside the cells that help build proteins. and again, the ribosomes and bacteria are different enough from the ribosomes and human cells that they are a great Target for these antibiotics. and if you interfere with the protein synthesis of the bacteria, that could slow the growth or even potentially kill the bacteria, and there are multiple different classes of antibiotics that work to inhibit some portion of the ribosome or some step in this protein synthesis, and I'll give you an example of an antibiotic from each of the major classes. maybe you've heard of neomin- doxycycl is from another class, isomyosin from another, and maybe You' even heard of chloromycin. some antibiotics work to inhibit or block certain steps in the process of bacterial DNA synthesis and I know I sound like a little bit of a broken record, but there are differences in how bacteria synthesize DNA versus how human cells synthesize DNA. so again, another potential difference to to exploit. now, if a bacterial cell can't properly synthesize its DNA, probably not going to be a big surprise that that could slow its growth or even potentially kill the bacterial cell, and there are, again, multiple antibiotic examples that work in this way. maybe you've heard of Baum. another antibiotic from a different class that you may have also heard about is called cyprol flasin. now, I did mention earlier that there are some small differences between the cell membranes of bacteria versus the cell membranes of human cells, but not a lot of differences and therefore there aren't very many an biotics that work to disrupt the cell membrane of bacteria. there are a few. maybe you've heard of the polymixin or maybe even daptomycin, but again, wouldn't be shocked if you haven't heard of those because, again, not very many antibiotics work in this way. ## How Do Antibiotics Help the Human Body? but now that we know the main ways that antibiotics can actually kill or slow the growth of bacteria, how can they help the human body? it probably isn't going to come as a surprise. the main benefit of antibiotics is to treat infections that the body couldn't fight off or would have trouble fighting off on its own. but let's be sure to give antibiotics their credit here. the discovery and use of antibiotics is arguably one of the most important medical contributions of the 20th century. antibiotics have helped to increase the average human life expectancy and have saved a countless number of lives that would otherwise have been shortened due to infection. however, sometimes us humans have a little bit of a hard time containing ourselves and can use too much of a good thing, because antibiotics are definitely overused to treat certain conditions or infections that shouldn't require the use of an antibiotic. and remember that selective toxicity principle: even though antibiotics were not designed to directly Target specific structures of our own cells, to kill them or inhibit their growth, that doesn't mean they can't come with some side effects, potential allergic reactions or even some level of toxicity with certain concentrations of the drug. and let's go back to that idea of using them too much. misuse or overuse of antibiotics have contrib attributed to bacteria developing resistance to certain antibiotics, making it more difficult to ## The Potential Side Effects and Harm of Antibiotics treat certain infections. so let's give some examples of some potential side effects and even some potential harm that can occur with antibiotic use, and then, of course, we'll finish up with antibiotic resistance. and some of the most common set of side effects that can occur with almost any antibiotic are GI symptoms, upset stomach, nausea and, of course, that wonderful diarrhea sometimes referred to as antibiotic Associated Di diarrhea. now, luckily for most people, this is more of a temporary annoyance and the diarrhea will improve and things will go back to normal after the antibiotic course is completed. now there are some people where the diarrhea can get bad enough where they may need to consider changing to a different antibiotic, and one of the reasons why antibiotic Associated diarrhea is thought to occur is due to this use of a broad spectrum antibiotic. broadspectrum antibiotic is an antibiotic that has activity against multiple different types of BAC bacteria. so, yes, it would kill the pathogen that's causing the infection, but could also kill and disrupt the bacteria that normally reside within your gut, often referred to as the normal flora. but again, this is often a temporary disruption for most people and the normal flora can recover. ##- Worst Diarrhea of Your Life- C Diff. however, there are some people that are a bit more unfortunate and can get things that are worse than the typical antibiotic Associated diarrhea. they can get a secondary infection due to suppression of the normal flora. one of those is clostridium defil infection, often referred to as SEI, now those that are colonized with SEI in their colon. the SEI bacteria is typically kept in check or held at Bay by that normal flora, but when they take certain antibiotics, especially things like clomin or cyof loxin, but even sometimes the penicillins or sephos sporin can cause this- the normal flora- enough of it- can get killed or suppressed- that that sea diff can start to overgrow, grow out of control and cause an active infection, and anybody who's had SE diff knows it's no joke. moderate to severe cases- we're talking multiple bouts of watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, fever, water and electrolyte imbalances, and in severe cases they may need to be treated with a fecal transplant or even ## Antibiotics & Yeast Infections- potentially surgery. another example of this concept is the development of a yeast infection. some females May notice that after taking a course of a broad spectrum antibiotic. but they could develop a yeast infection as that rods spectrum antibiotic could suppress the normal vagin Flora, allowing that candida or the yeast to overgrow, causing that. ## Antibiotics & Allergic Reactions- infection. another unintended consequence of antibiotic use is an allergic reaction and I have plenty of patients that have an allergy to a certain antibiotic. for example, it's estimated that anywhere from 1 to 10% of patients can have some level of hypers sensitivity to the penicillins. now, luckily again, most of those hypers sensitivities or those allergies are mild and mostly annoying like a maculopapular rash, but some- about 0. 5%- can have the most serious hypers sensitivity reaction: anaphylaxis. fortunately, death due to anaphylaxis from penicillin is quite uncommon and there are multiple antibiotics that we can choose from if somebody does have a hypers sensitivity to a certain antibiotic but still needs treatment for ##- Risks of Antibiotic Misuse and Overuse- an infection. so everything we've talked about so far definitely does not cover every potential side effect or reaction that can occur with antibiotic use. that could take quite a bit of time if we continue down that road, but I will include some additional side effects that are associated with some commonly used antibiotics in the description below. the point is: as beneficial as antibiotics can be, they don't come without some Associated risks, and that's one of the reasons why we don't want to just use them all willy-nilly. we want to use them when appropriate, like the classic misuse example: taking an antibiotic for a viral respiratory infection that the body could just get over on its own. now we're not just concerned about reducing the risk of unintended Side Effects by giving somebody an antibiotic when they don't need one. we're also concerned about reducing the risk of antibiotic resistance. bacteria are pesky little critters that have the ability to adapt and change in order to avoid being killed or suppressed by antibiotics. for example, there are some bacteria that have adapted to produce betalactamases, which are enzymes that cleave the structural component of the antibiotic class, the betal lactams, essentially inactivating those antibiotics. and, if you remember, the ayin and the sephos sporns belong to that betalactam class. so those antibiotics would not work well against bacteria that can produce those betalactamase enzymes. bacteria can also modify their ribosomes so that they're no longer a viable Target for certain antibiotics. they can also change their cell membrane permeability and also can create little cellular pumps that can actively pump the antibiotic out of themselves. you can kind of think of this as survival of the fittest, in a way. as we continue to use antibiotics, the bacteria that are susceptible will be killed and die off, but those bacteria that are resistant could continue to survive and they could share this genetic information that codes for resistance as they grow and divide. and bacteria can even share genetic information with other bacteria in their surrounding environment. on one hand, that's super fascinating. on another hand it's a little bit freaky, decky, but hopefully this gives you some good ideas of the importance of sound medical decision making and only using antibiotics when necessary, versus just relying on that good oldfashioned immune system. and, of course, it wouldn't be an Institute of human anatomy video if I didn't get a chance to say how excited I am about one of my favorite lifelong learning tools, and that is brilliant. brilliantorg is an amazing interactive online learning platform for stem subjects and I really believe it is one of the best and most fun engaging ways to learn math, science and computer science. I've been using brilliant for almost 2 years now and it has definitely helped me to refine and sharpen past skills as well as develop new ones. I recently started one of their new lessons called exploring data visually, which is all about analyzing and interpreting data from visualizing charts and graphs, which has definitely been helpful for me. plus, brilliant is constantly adding more of these lessons each and every month, so you'll definitely find lessons and courses that are applicable to you, no matter where you are on your educational Journey. so if you're interested in checking out this amazing learning platform, go to brilliantorg to start a free 30-day trial, plus the ## Support The Channel first. 200 people will get 20% off their annual subscription. we'll also include that information and the link in the description below. thanks for watching our crazy Anatomy videos. everyone like And subscribe if you feel the need and, of course, leave some comments below. let us know what you thought of the video and we'll see you next time.\n"
